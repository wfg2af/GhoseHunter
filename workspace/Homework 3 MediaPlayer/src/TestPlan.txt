We chose the 4 test cases because the first case, which tested addPlayList, first tested to see if
a playlist was added. The second case, also testing addPlayList, then tested to see if when multiple
playlists with the same name were added that it would not add duplicates. The 3rd case tested add
playable, which was chosen because it tested to see if both a song and a video could be added and they
could.

The 4th case was tricky. loadMedia worked for the longest time and would load media no problem. But then
I submitted my code to webcat and it didn't like it even though in my working test case it tested all 
tricks that could have been put in, as stated in the assignment sheet. Of course though, webcat does not
like exactly how I did it and I was forced to change my code. Webcat likes my new code a little better
but now it does not function on my computer. This does not make sense, the main issue, it seems, is that
trim() is not functioning right for me. I don't know why, especially because it was working perfectly before. 
I tried doing .replace(" ", ""); to get rid of spaces, which worked, but webcat batted it's mighty paw
at me and said no, use trim. So I did. But my code here still doesn't work like it used to. Maybe it's just
on my computer, because I did not have any issues with trim previously. I'm not sure what has changed
since last project to make such a change.
